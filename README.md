# Pokédex CLI

The Pokédex CLI is an exploration of implementing a CLI using Go. Data for the Pokédex is fetched from the [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co).

## Requirements

The app requires Go. All development and testing was completed using Go `1.21`. Other versions may work but have not been tested.

## Running the App

Run the following command in the terminal from the root directory to launch the app:

```shell
% go build && ./pokedex
```

Type "help" to get a list of commands:

```shell
Pokedex > help
```

Exit the app by type "exit".

```shell
Pokedex > exit
```
